+ Main purpose of agile
  * react quickly to changing needs
  * rapid feedback
  * feasibility (for R&D or speculative investors)
  * low capital investment

SLIDE- (comparative techniques)

  * waterfall vs iterative
    - traditionally one long plan with an end goal
    - relies too heavily on up-front design and architecture
    - too much opportunity for something to change or go wrong

    - iterative development gets features in front of users
    - leaves room for changing direction
    - deploys early and often

SLIDE- (forms of agile)

+ Forms of agile
  * falls loosely into two categories
    - iterative (scrum, XP)
    - sequential (lean / kanban)
  * some shared principles
    - lots of communication
    - bugs always get priority

SLIDE- (iterative)

  * Iterative
    - team works in 1 or 2 week iterations / sprints
    - weekly team / client meetings
      + iteration planning meeting
      + project retrospective
    - daily team meetings
    - regular team retrospectives

    - work on an agreed backlog of small tasks or,
    - "epic" deliverable feature
    - benefits
     + "epics" allow team to focus
     + forces client to commit to a fixed block of work
     + short enough commitment to allow client to change direction or stop
     + can be used as client billing / signoff cycle
    - requires regular but not constant client access, therefore
    - ideal for client consultancies
