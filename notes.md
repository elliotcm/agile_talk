+ Main purpose of agile
  * $$$
  * react quickly to changing needs
    - rapid feedback
    - feasibility (for R&D or speculative investors)
    - low capital investment

SLIDE- (comparative techniques)

  * waterfall vs iterative
    - traditionally one long plan with an end goal
    - relies too heavily on up-front design and architecture
    - too much opportunity for something to change or go wrong

    - iterative development gets features in front of users
    - leaves room for changing direction
    - deploys early and often

SLIDE- (forms of agile)

+ Forms of agile
  * falls loosely into two categories
    - iterative (scrum, XP)
    - sequential (lean / kanban)
  * some shared principles
    - lots of communication
    - bugs always get priority

SLIDE- (iterative)

  * Iterative
    - team works in 1 or 2 week iterations / sprints
    - weekly team / client meetings
      + iteration planning meeting
      + project retrospective
    - daily team meetings
    - regular team retrospectives

    - work on an agreed backlog of small tasks or,
    - "epic" deliverable feature

    - benefits
      + "epics" allow team to focus
      + forces client to commit to a fixed block of work
      + short enough commitment to allow client to change direction or stop
      + can be used as client billing / signoff cycle
    - requires regular but not constant client access, therefore
    - ideal for client consultancies

SLIDE- (sequential)

  * Sequential
    - JIT development
    - reduces wastage
      + backlog
      + cognitive load

    - backlog always prioritised by client (or representative)
    - most granular form of prioritisation

    - requires near-constant access to client
    - ideal for in-house teams, close to the business

SLIDE- (environments)

  * most people in one of 3
    - client consultancies
    - in-house build & maintenance teams
    - R&D departments

SLIDE- (client consultancies)

  * your main problem is the client, love & hate

  * often don't know what they want until they see a version in action
  * change their minds constantly

  * Pressure from market forces, investors, dev feedback

SLIDE- (in-house teams)

  * market shifts, business must move with it
  * much of the same issues as consultancy, "internal client"

SLIDE- (r&d department)

  * ideal use case
    - many internal clients for many short projects
    - rapid prototyping
    - feasibility studies
  * agile gives very short feedback cycle

  * all types must react to technical difficulties

SLIDE- (which to choose?)

  * usually custom version
    - don't follow books too closely
    - do what suits client, team, project in that order
  * at Reevoo
    - custom iterative
    - project planning meetings
    - retrospectives
    - 20% time
  * previous company, client consultancy
    - mostly custom iterative
      + allowed iterative billing
      + provided good point to touch base, mix things up
    - some lean/kanban

SLIDE- (take-home points)

  * Use small teams (1-3 pairs)
  * Give them freedom (tech, time, working habits, and process)
  * Try out both styles, and adapt for your clients and team
  * Don't be a slave to the rules
  * Eradicate old thinking

SLIDE- (title slide)

  * thank you, questions
