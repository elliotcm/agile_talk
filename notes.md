+ Main purpose of agile
  * react quickly to changing needs
  * rapid feedback
  * feasibility (for R&D or speculative investors)
  * low capital investment

SLIDE- (comparative techniques)

  * waterfall vs iterative
    - traditionally one long plan with an end goal
    - relies too heavily on up-front design and architecture
    - too much opportunity for something to change or go wrong

    - iterative development gets features in front of users
    - leaves room for changing direction
    - deploys early and often
